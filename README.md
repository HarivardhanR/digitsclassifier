# Getting Started
### Webpage
You can train,test Convolutional Neural Network [here](https://harivardhanr.github.io/digitsclassifier).
The webpage contains the following buttons __guess__,__train__,__test__ and __clear__.
### Guess button
The model outputs the digit you drew on the canvas.It also outputs the probability of other numbers it thinks the digit is,darker the digit's 
corresponding cirle higher the probability.
### Clear button
clears the canvas.
### Test button
Used to test how well the Neural network has been trained.Testing of model is done with 1000 images.
### Train button
Used to train the model.Training of model is done with 10,000 images.More the Train images the better the model's outputs.
###### NOTE : training with more number of images in low-end PC may take a long time.
# Built with
